              <p> What does Code Clone / Duplicate Code mean?
	                <p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="font-size:30px;">Duplicate code is a computer programming term for a sequence of source code that occurs more than once, either within a program or across different programs owned or maintained by the same entity.

              </h4>
              <p style="font-size:30px">
                  The approach uses Deep Learning namely two Recurrent Neural Networks to detect clones.
                  <br><br>
                  This approach is different from the other approaches because it does not depend on <b>handcrafted features </b> to represent code.

              <p style="font-size:20px">
                  Data was collected From Various Java systems <br>
                  <br>
                  Examined the following Questions : <br>
                  <b>RQ1 </b> Are our representations suitable for detecting fragments that are similar with respect to a clone type?
                  <br>
                  <b>RQ2</b> Is there evidence that our compositional, learningbased approach is capable of recognizing clones that
                  are undetected or suboptimally reported by a traditional, structure-oriented technique?

                  <li> Files could have been sorted by size so the training time would have been reduced.</li>

                  <li> Code clones are sometimes difficult to detect but are very important to find for Softwares.</li>

                  <li> Learning based clone detection using two Recurrent Neural Networks and overall had a good accuracy.</li>
